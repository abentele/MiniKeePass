          <h3>Welcome.</h3>

<p>MiniKeePassX is a brand new password tool for Mac OS X. While it is based on the KeePass library implemented in the <a href="http://minikeepass.github.com">MiniKeePass</a> iOS App, the application is inspired by the reference implementation <a href="http://keepass.info">KeePass Password Save</a> and <a href="http://www.keepassx.org">KeePassX</a>. MiniKeePassX can load and save files created with KeePass Password Save, MiniKeePass or KeePassX.</p>

<h3>MiniKeePassX</h3>

<p>MiniKeePassX is a code name. I'm currently searching for a good and distinct product name. If you have suggestions please tell me: <a href="mailto:abentele.github@icloud.com">abentele.github@icloud.com</a></p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>MiniKeePassX is in an early development stage. I use my spare time to implement it, so don't ask me when it will be ready, but maybe you will see the first distributable version within the first quarter of 2013.</p>

<p>MiniKeePassX will be distributed over the App Store for OS X. </p>

<h3>Why implementing another KeePass tool</h3>

<p>I was using KeePassX for a few years. KeePassX is another very good KeePass tool with an emphasis on platform independence. The implementation is based on C++ and the QT library. The downsides of this platform independent approach is poor usability and missing OS X specific features like versions and other document based features. With KeePassX 2 the look and feel of the application will be better, but I believe devoutly that a native OS X application can provide a much better user experience.</p>

<h3>License</h3>

<p>MiniKeePassX (like MiniKeePass) is Open Source and distributed under the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>The source code is available for security audit or contribution on <a href="https://github.com/abentele/MiniKeePass">github</a>.</p>

<h3>Do you want to contribute?</h3>

<p>I started this project in December 2012. If you want to contribute, feel free to contact me: <a href="mailto:abentele.github@icloud.com">abentele.github@icloud.com</a></p>

<p>As a contributor you...</p>

<ul>
<li>implement new features</li>
<li>provide bug fixes</li>
<li>provide icons</li>
<li>translate the application</li>
<li>propose new features or improvements</li>
<li>test the application</li>
<li>distribute the application</li>
</ul><h3>Design principles</h3>

<p>As a contributor you should be aware of these design principles:</p>

<p>The github repository is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/MiniKeePass/MiniKeePass">MiniKeePass repository</a>. The implementation is made in a branch named "osx". </p>

<p>All OS X related implementation is an extension to the original MiniKeePass code. The original MiniKeePass code should not be changed for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>the MiniKeePass code will change in future. It would be easier to merge improvements in the MiniKeePass code if we don't change that code.</li>
<li>maybe the creators of the original MiniKeePass app will decide one day to merge the OS X related code to their repository (I would be very happy about that!). This will be simpler if there are no merge conflicts. My vision is to have one repository for both MiniKeePass for iOS and OS X one day.</li>
</ul>
